- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (Preprocessor) for CSS [https://sass-lang.com/]
- SCSS syntax
- SASS variables
- Javascript
- Glide.js for slider component [https://glidejs.com/]

### What I learned

This challenge allowed me to train in a similar way to the previous one (single-page developer portfolio) regarding the different layouts of the sections, and to implement a "slider" of photographs, and overall I think I achieved the objectives clearly and without too many difficulties.

### Continued development

In this case, there wasn't a real challenge regarding the use of Javascript, as the only element that used it was the slider, it was more of a challenge regarding the design and layout.

### Useful resources

- [https://glidejs.com/](https://glidejs.com/) - This Javascript library helped me because thanks to it I implemented the photo slider required by the design, regarding its structure and operation. I customized it and adapted it to the requested design. Overall it was a great resource, lightweight, and easy to edit. Super recommended.
